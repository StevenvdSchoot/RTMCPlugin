RTMCPlugin
==========

The official RTMC bukkit plugin as its used on www.rushteamc.com

Compilation
-----------

We use maven to handle our dependencies.

* Install [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
* Check out and install [Bukkit](http://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit)
    * *Note*: this is not needed as maven will uses a repository that has Bukkit too, but you might have a newer one (with your own changes :D)
* Check out this repo and: `mvn clean package`

Jenkins
-------

We have a Jenkins repo on [rushteamc.com](http://rushteamc.com:8080/job/RTMCPlugin/) where you can find the latest artifects.
